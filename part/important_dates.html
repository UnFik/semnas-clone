                Emerging Post Pandemic Trends of Research and Education in

                Covid 19 brings dramatic changes in all sectors of life.
                Education has changed with the distinctive rise of e-learning.
                Learning experiences during the pandemic are carried out with
                the concept of digital education undertaken on many platforms.
                Higher education is forced to accelerate the implementation of
                this online learning style. Although universities have e-
                learning ecosystems in place, yet these environments are mostly
                designed for blended learning. Predictions about movement in the
                post pandemic time, whether implementing the pre-existing models
                of blended learning or moving into a flexible and agile learning
                ecosystem in line with 5th industrial revolution are still a
                debatable issue. Constraints faced while learning from home,
                will provide experience in the implementation of post-pandemic
                education.

                Education hasnt been the only field impacted by pandemic.
                Economy, health and human well-being were also suffering from
                it. research is needed to make feasible concrete ways of
                surviving. Unfortunately, the research pattern is disrupted due
                to the need of effort in being able to live side by side with
                the virus. Unpredicted noticeable huge innovations even appear
                which were never thought of before.

                Science, mathematics and education play an important role in
                adapting to the new world in the post pandemic era. The third
                Science and Mathematics International Conference (SMIC) aims to
                bring together academics, scientists, students, and
                practitioners to share and discuss theoretical and practical
                knowledge, new trends and application in those fields related to
                post pandemic issues. The previous 1st and 2nd conference has
                brought huge success in aligning more than 6 countries
                participants in the events and delivering to international
                reputable book as well as proceeding.
